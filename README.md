# The Tales Curator
Tool to create realistic looking RPG content using Markdown & BBCode (I guess).
Currently supporting D&D 5e, planning on supporting (at least) Warhammer Fantasy RP.

## Thanks
This tool was made using:
  -  [Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) as its editor
  -  [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) (modified) as its markdown parser
  -  [Solbera D&D Fonts](https://github.com/jonathonf/solbera-dnd-fonts) for the *free* version of the fonts
  -  [The Homebrewery](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery) for some images


## Disclaimer
I took some inspiration concerning the syntax from [The Homebrewery](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery) and [GMBinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/).  
However, I deny having stolen (or used) any of their codes / scripts / whatever.  

This tool is still early in development. I put it on github for testing purposes. Feel free to make suggestions concerning any aspect of the tool.  
You can take and reuse my code, I don't care. You can also use some images I took the time to vectorize by hand.  

## Planned

- [ ] Easy Font Customization (similar to what's for the colors)
- [ ] Easy Appearence Customization (Page Background, Footer, maybe other)
- [ ] Custom CSS Editor 
- [ ] WFRP Theme
