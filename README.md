# The Tales Curator
Tool to create realistic looking RPG content using Markdown & BBCode (I guess).
Currently supporting D&D 5e, planning on supporting (at least) Warhammer Fantasy RP.

## Thanks
This tool was made using:
  -  [Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) as its editor
  -  [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) (modified) as its markdown parser
  -  [Solbera D&D Fonts](https://github.com/jonathonf/solbera-dnd-fonts) for the *free* version of the fonts
  -  [The Homebrewery](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery) for some images
  -  [Sovngarde Font](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/386) for the subtitles of the part. I like this font.
  -  [Jared Ondricek](https://watercolors.giantsoup.com/) for the watercolors. I took some and transformed them into masks.


## Disclaimer
I took some inspiration concerning the syntax from [The Homebrewery](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery) and [GMBinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/).  
However, I deny having stolen (or used) any of their codes / scripts / whatever.  

This tool is still early in development. I put it on github for testing purposes. Code is messy as hell, I will fix it later.  
Feel free to make suggestions concerning any aspect of the tool.  
You can take and reuse my code, I don't care. You can also use some images I took the time to vectorize by hand.  

## Planned

- [x] Easy Font Customization (similar to what's for the colors)
- [ ] Document's Variables
- [ ] More Preview Features (zoom in / zoom out)
- [x] Easy Appearence Customization (Page Background, Footer, maybe other)
- [ ] Custom CSS Editor 
- [ ] WFRP Theme
- [ ] Auto Table of Contents (although hyperlinks don't work when saving as PDF...)
